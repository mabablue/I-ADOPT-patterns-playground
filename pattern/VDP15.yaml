name: property (cover)
comment: Cover expresses the fraction of a total reference area that is occupied by the oject of interest. Using area fraction is more precise than cover for the property. 
design: Asymmetric system (numerator/denominator) at the object of interest slot. The portion is represented by the numerator, the total reference area by the denominator.
