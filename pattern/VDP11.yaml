type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP11.yaml
name: property (ordinal)
comment: An ordinal variable has values corresponding to a list of concepts that can be put in a certain order but are not measured. They are generally qualitative, and the classes can therefore only be ordered in relation to each other. Dates are also ordinal values.
design: The property should be as generic as possible to be reusable. Use single object of interest. No link to the actual controlled list is required, as we want a generic term, not how it has been applied (similar to units for quantitative values)
