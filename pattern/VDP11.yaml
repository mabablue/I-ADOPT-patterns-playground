type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP11.yaml
name: Property: ordinal
comment: An ordinal variable has values corresponding to classes that can be put in a certain order but are not measured. They are generally qualitative, and the classes can therefore only be ordered in relation to each other.
design: The property should be as generic as possible to be reusable.
