name: Constraint: normalization
comment: A constraint that specifies the reference quantity relative to which the property value is expressed. The property is normalized relative to some reference quantity. 
The constraint is on a property only. It starts with "per unit" and adds the reference quantity (mass, volumen, area, time).
