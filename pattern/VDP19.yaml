type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP19.yaml
name: property (distance)
comment: The length between two Cartesian coordinates in space (absolute length) requiring two objects to be specified.
design: Asymmetric (with source/target) or symmetric system (with parts) in the object of interest, depending if the parts involved have different roles.
