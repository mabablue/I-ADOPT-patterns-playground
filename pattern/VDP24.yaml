name: property (count)
comment: A count property is a derived data property that assigns to an entity a non-negative integer equal to the number of distinct related entities satisfying a declared relation and scope.
design: Simple property using "count" or "number" as its concept label. Use single object of interest and a matrix of type reference area.
involved_components:
  - property
