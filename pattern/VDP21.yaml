name: property (fraction)
comment: A fraction is a ratio comparing a part to the whole where the quantities are of the same kind. Not included is here area fraction.
design: Fractions needs to be specified. Requires an aymmetric system (numerator/deonominator) for the object of interest.
instances:
  - mole fraction
  - mass fraction
involved_components:
  - property
  - object of interest (asymmetric system - numerator/denominator)
