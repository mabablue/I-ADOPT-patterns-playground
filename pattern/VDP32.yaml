name: object of interest (property)
comment: When there is a property of the property of interest 
design: the second property becomes the role of the object of interest, requires in addition the matrix. Depending on the property type the object of interest is either a system or a single entity.

  - difference (symmetric system)
  - distance (symmetric system)
