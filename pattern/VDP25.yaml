name: Property: index
comment: An index acts as a proxy property that normalizes data against a specific base point or reference value to provide relative context rather than absolute measurement. While it sometimes aggregates multiple variables into a single score, its primary function is to make diverse data sets comparable over time or across different subjects.
design: The property requires a constraint: defined by to provide definition context. The object of interest is single.
