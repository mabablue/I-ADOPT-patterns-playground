name: property (index)
comment: An index acts as a proxy property that normalizes data against a specific base point or reference value to provide relative context rather than absolute measurement. While it sometimes aggregates multiple variables into a single score, its primary function is to make diverse data sets comparable over time or across different subjects.
design: The property requires a constraint (defined by) to provide the definition context. The object of interest is single entity.
