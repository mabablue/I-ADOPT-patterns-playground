type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP12.yaml
name: property (nominal)
comment: A nominal variable has values of equal importance that cannot be ranked in any particular order (non-ordinal), e.g., species of pests, colors. The values of these variables are usually indicated by words, ideally using controlled lists.
design: The property should be as generic as possible to be reusable.
