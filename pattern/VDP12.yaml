type: Variable Design Pattern

name: Property: nominal
comment: A nominal variable has values of equal importance that cannot be ranked in any particular order (non-ordinal), e.g., species of pests, colors. The values of these variables are usually indicated by words, ideally using controlled lists.
design: The property should be as generic as possible to be reusable.
