type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP13.yaml
name: Property: material specific density
comment: The density of the solid material itself. It is "specific" to the chemical substance, regardless of how that substance is physically arranged (as a powder, a sponge, or a solid block).
design: Density must be specified without using a constraint. Use single object in the object of interest.
instances:
  - surface number density (particle per area, people per area)
  - bulk density (material specific density)
