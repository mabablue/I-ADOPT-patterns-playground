type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP17.yaml
name: property (concentration)
comment: Concentration describes how much of one substance (the solute) is present in another substance (the solvent). Thus, using a concentration property always implies the existence of both a solute and a solvent. 
design: Requires asymmetric system (numerator/denominator) in the object of interest with the solute in the numerator and the solvent in the denominator.
instances:
  - mass concentration
  - molar concentration
involved_components:
  - property
  - object of interest (asymmetric system - numerator/denominator)
