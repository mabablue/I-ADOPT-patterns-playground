name: property (concentration)
comment: Concentration describes how much of one substance (the solute) is present in another substance (the solvent). Thus, using a concentration property always implies the existence of both a solute (object of interest) and a solvent (matrix of type embedding material). 
design: Requires asymmetric system (numerator/denominator) in the object of interest.
