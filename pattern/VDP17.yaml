name: Property: concentration
comment: Concentration describes how much of one substance (the solute) is present in another substance (the solvent). 
Thus, using a concentration property always implies the existence of both a solute (Object of Interest) and a solvent (Matrix of type embedding material). 
In addition, the property must be specific and include also the type (mass, molar, volume). 
Affected:
  components:
    - Property
    - Object of Interest (asymmetric system)
