name: Property: concentration
comment: Concentration describes how much of one substance (the solute) or object of interest) is present in another substance (the solvent). Thus, using a concentration property always implies the existence of both a solute (Object of Interest) and a solvent (Matrix of type embedding material). In addition the property must be specific and include also the type (mass, molar, volume). The normalization (per unit mass, per unit volume) is added as a constraint.
