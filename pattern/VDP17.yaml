type: Variable Design Pattern

name: Property - concentration
comment: Concentration describes how much of one substance (the solute) is present in another substance (the solvent). Thus, using a concentration property always implies the existence of both a solute (Object of Interest) and a solvent (Matrix of type embedding material). 
design: Requires asymmetric system (numerator/denominator in the object of interest.
