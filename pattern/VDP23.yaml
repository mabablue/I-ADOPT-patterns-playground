type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP23.yaml
name: property (flux complex)
comment: A flux is a ratio rate which is represented as an asymmetric system for object of interest and with an asymmetric system for matrix, which is the flow from a source to a target. Complex representation is needed, when there needs to be a constraint on the denominator. 
Affected:
  components:
  - property
  - constraint
  - object of interest
  - matrix
  - asymmetric system
  constrained:
  - deonminator
