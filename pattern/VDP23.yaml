type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP23.yaml
name: property (flux complex)
comment: A flux is a ratio rate. Complex representation is needed, when there needs to be a constraint on the denominator. 
design: Requires asymmetric system for object of interest (numerator/denominator) and matrix (source/target).
