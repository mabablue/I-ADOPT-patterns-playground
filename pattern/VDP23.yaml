type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP23.yaml
name: Property: flux complex
comment: A flux is a  ratio rate which is represented as a asymmetric system for OoI and with a asymmetric system for matrix, which is the flow from a source to a target. 
Complex representation is needed, when there needs to be a constraint on the denominator. 
Affected:
  components:
    - Property
    - Constraint
    - Object of Interest
    - Matrix
    - Asymmetric System
  constrained:
    - Deonminator
