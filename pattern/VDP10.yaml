name: Property - fundamental
comment: Fundamental properties are physical quantities that is conventionally accepted as functionally independent of all others.
design: Do not further decompose these terms. Use single object of interest.
instances:
     - thermodynamic temperature
     - time 
     - mass
     - amount of substance
     - luminous intensity
     - electric current
     - length (see VDP16)
