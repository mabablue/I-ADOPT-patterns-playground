id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP26.yaml
name: Property: flux simplified
comment: A flux is a flow from a source to a target and requires an asymmetric system for the matrix. 
In addition, the property must be specific and must include also the type (mass, energy). 
Affected:
  components:
    - Property
    - Constraint
    - Matrix
    - Asymmetric System
