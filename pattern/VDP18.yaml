type: Variable Design Pattern
id: https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/pattern/VDP18.yaml
name: Property: flux
comment: A flux is a flow from a source to a target and requires an asymmetric system for the matrix. 
In addition, the property must be specific and include also the type (mass, energy). 
Normalization constraints per unit time and per unit area are required.
