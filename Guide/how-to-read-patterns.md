## How to use and read PATTERNS:
Use one PATTERN for each description component (apart from constraints for which more might be needed), guided by decision trees

A Pattern is a decomposition design guide including this information:
- id: a URL to the pattern
- name
- comment: description of the pattern
- design: instructions how to model
- instances: a list of examples
- involved_components: involved description components
- constrained_components
- associated_patterns: other patterns that might be required using this pattern
- associated_mappings: mapping patterns that can be used with this pattern
- example: one example applying the pattern
- gh_issue: one issue that shows the example
