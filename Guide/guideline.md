## 1. Step:
Analyse the sentence and, if necessary, rewrite it to provide a clear interpretation of a phenomenon or entity. The help of a domain expert might be useful. Leave out details about the unit of measurements, the method and the instrument but keep the rest.

E.g. Atmospheric optical thickness of particulate organic matter at 550nm under ambient conditions.

-> Optical thickness of organic particle in aerosol in atmosphere at 550nm 
(ambient conditions is already captured in the term atmosphere; 

## 2. Step:
Segment the text into atomic parts based on meaning rather than syntax. Ensure that composite terms remain intact if further decomposition would result in a loss of specialized context. Example: “atmospheric boundary layer”. 

Use one PATTERN for each description component (apart from constraints for which more might be needed), guided by decision trees

## 3. Step
Determine the property

Be as precise as possible and use a known physical quantity rather than a community convention to increase the clarity and reusability of the terms. In case the description uses a community convention use the physical quantity and add a *constraint: type* on it.
