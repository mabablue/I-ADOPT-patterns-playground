## 1. Step:
Analyse the sentence and, if necessary, rewrite it to provide a clear interpretation of a phenomenon or entity. The help of a domain expert might be useful. Leave out details about the unit of measurements, the method and the instrument but keep the rest.

E.g. Atmospheric optical thickness of particulate organic matter at 550nm under ambient conditions.

-> Optical thickness of organic particle in aerosol in atmosphere at 550nm 
(ambient conditions is already captured in the term atmosphere; 

## 2. Step:
Segment the text into atomic parts based on meaning rather than syntax. Ensure that composite terms remain intact if further decomposition would result in a loss of specialized context. Example: “atmospheric boundary layer”. 

Use one PATTERN for each description component (apart from constraints for which more might be needed), guided by decision trees

## 3. Step
Determine the Property

Be as precise as possible and use a known physical quantity rather than a community convention to increase the clarity and reusability of the terms. In case the description uses a community convention use the physical quantity and add a *constraint: type* on it. 

**Decision trees:**
- [qualitative properties](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT0.mmd)
- [quantitative properties](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT1.mmd)
- [derived properties](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT2.mmd)
- [flux properties](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT3.mmd)
- [ratio properties](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT4.mmd)

## 4. Step
Determine the Object of Interest

**Decision trees:**
- [Object of Interest](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT5.mmd)
- [Property vs Object of Interest vs Matrix](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT6.mmd)

## 5. Step
Determine the Matrix

**Decision trees:**
- [Property vs Object of Interest vs Matrix](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT6.mmd)
- [Matrix](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT7.mmd)

## 6. Step
Determine if the Statistical Modifiers are involved.

## 7. Step
Determine Constraints and place them under the correct component

**Decision trees:**
- [Constraints on Entity](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT8.mmd)
- [Constraints on Property](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT9.mmd)
- [Constraints on Statisticical Modifier](https://github.com/mabablue/I-ADOPT-patterns-playground/blob/main/Decisition_trees/DT10.mmd)

## 8. Step
Add Context Object, if necessary, to add clarity. They can be spheres or environments like river, sea, lake.
