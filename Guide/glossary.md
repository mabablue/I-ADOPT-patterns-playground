  - id: a URL to the pattern
  - name
  - comment: description of the pattern
  - design: instructions how to model
  - instances: a list of examples
  - involved_components: involved description components
  - constrained_components
  - associated_patterns: other patterns that might be required using this pattern

  - example: one example applying the pattern
  - gh_issue: one issue that shows the example
